# JS Snapshotting

This is an experiment to create a JavaScript sandbox (in a JavaScript host) that can be snapshotted.

This is under development. Have a look at [.dev-journal/](./.dev-journal/2023-12-02%20first%20steps.md) for my notes as I develope this.

Note: I've had issues under node.js 18 but it seems to be working ok in the browser and in node.js 20 (in Windows).
